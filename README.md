# IGM-Vis
Interactive visualization of intergalactic medium (IGM) data

Welcome to a new way to explore combined QSO spectra and galaxy survey datasets!  Our web-based
application puts you in the Cosmic Web to reveal the connections between galaxies, their gaseous
halos, and the environments where they live.

The blue and red spheres represent star-forming and quiescent galaxies, respectively, and the
'skewers' piercing the volume are QSO sightlines.  Mouse over a galaxy to see an image and a few
of its properties in the lower panel.  Mouse over a skewer and the right-hand panels show the spectral
region where H I and C IV (if available) would fall in the redshift range we are studying.  If a
galaxy has an impact parameter within the range indicated by the bottom-right slider, a
vertical line will appear at its redshift in the spectral window.  Use the two drop-down boxes to
control the height and thickness of these lines according to different properties.  Lastly, control
the range of redshift shown in the spectral windows with the sizing bar between the drop-downs and
the slider.

If you find interesting galaxy/absorber pairs, use the numeric keys and 'G' to keep track and use
'D' to save these to disk for your own detailed analysis.  Enjoy!
